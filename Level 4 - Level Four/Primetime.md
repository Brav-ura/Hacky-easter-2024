# Solution
Since the channels are naturally numbered, let's start by deleting all that aren't in a prime number and go from there.

```
02 Tele 2  
03 El Tele Tre  
05 Local News  
07 Epic Movies  
11 Cold North TV  
13 Only News  
17 Music & More  
19 All The Comics  
23 No Man's Choice  
29 Dingo TV  
31 Only Techno
```

Tried to see if there's a show that has a prime number of letter's in it. So let's delete the channel numbers and just have the show names

```
Tele 2
El Tele Tre
Local News
Epic Movies
Cold North TV
Only News
Music & More
All The Comics
No Man's Choice
Dingo TV
Only Techno
```

But there is more than one, like Tele 2, Local News, and others, so this must not be it.

After some time of going back and forth between challenges, I finally saw that if only the first letter of each channel is taken, they spell TELECOMANDO, which is the correct flag.
