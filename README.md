# Hacky Easter 2024

Hacky Easter is a free, and open to all, Easter themed CTF that has a nice variety of challenges, like web, pwn/exploitation and crypto, among others. And not only that, but it tends to last for around 40 days, so there's no hurry to solve everything by hacking non stop (unless you're going for the first bloods). Because of this, it's hands down my favorite CTF series ever.

These are the write ups for my solutions to the Hacky Easter 2024 CTF challenges. Some scripts that I used are included in the corresponding level folder with the same name of the challenge.

While this is not my first Hacky Easter, this is the first time that I finally decided to document fully and publish it.
